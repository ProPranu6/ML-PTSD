<td>Data Formatting</td>
<td>- Rename columns to ensure both passive and Fitbit files have the same format, specifically including &lt;uid, start-date, end-date, sourceBundleId, value&gt; columns - Split timestamp information of Fitbit into ‘start-date’ and ‘end-date’ if not originally present - Incorporate sourceBundleId information explicitly to be originating from Fitbit if not present originally</td>
