<td>- Consider each overlapping time range portion as an independent interval  - If inconsistent records have different sourceBundleID, perform “mean” (for numeric) / “mode” (for categorical) across all inconsistent values  - If inconsistent records have the same sourceBundleID, retain inconsistent values  - Aggregate data for day and day-half levels information along with summary statistics following conceptual aggregation guidelines</td>

<td>Conceptual Aggregation</td>
<td>- Get the joining date from the file ‘/Volumes/MAVERICK/master-download/users.csv’ for each user. If a user’s join time is after 6 pm on the given date, then day 0 starts from 6 pm of that date. If the join time is before 6 pm on the given date, then day 0 begins from 6 pm of the previous day.  - Create day boundaries at 6pm of each day and split any time ranges spread across day boundaries into two separate time ranges  - Calculate days and day-half(s) elapsed by every time range starting from the joining date of each user for every stream, for 84 consecutive days  - Aggregate all the results, summary statistics in a day and day-half following the Table 3. aggregation_info</td>
